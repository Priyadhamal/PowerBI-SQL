# PowerBI-SQL

I have made a PowerBI dashboard using dataset of bank analysis. I have used various SQL queries as well.
Firstly I import the data then transform the data and done the data cleaning, like rename the column, delete null entries,etc.
Then I have used various dax functions and according to that I have done the Data Visualization.
In Data Visualization I have used bar graphs, slicers, line graph, table chart, etc.
